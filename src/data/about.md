# Intro

I am an interdisciplinary biomedical researcher. 
My academic and clinical training spans medicine, stem cell biology, and translational research. Through clinical practice, 
disease modeling with organoids, and genomics-driven projects, I have developed a multidisciplinary perspective on how complex 
diseases emerge, progress, and diversify.

&nbsp;

These experiences have shaped my interest in leading and contributing to biomedical 
research that integrates experimental platforms, molecular genetics, and evolutionary thinking.

&nbsp;

In particular, my interests center on:

1. **Project Leadership and Research Coordination**
2. **Stem Cell Biology**
3. **Molecular Genetics and Genomics**
4. **Phylogenetics and Evolutionary Biology**

I completed my PhD at [ULB Center for Diabetes Research](https://www.ucdr.be) under the
supervision of [Prof Miriam Cnop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Cnop), where my work focused on disease mechanism 
discovery using stem cell- and organoid-based models in a translational research setting. 

&nbsp;

I graduated in 2020 with my medical degree from The Second Xiangya Hospital,[Central South University](https://dmkeylab.csu.edu.cn/),
where I was advised by [Prof Zhiguang Zhou (周智广)](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/zhouzhiguang/en/index.htm).
Though being trained as a physician, however, my medical education has cultivated my keen interest in basic research of 
disease mechanisms.

&nbsp;

Leveraging clinical and omics resources, my PhD work utilizes iPSC-derived islets to understand disease mechanisms 
in a variant-specific model that replicates β cell phenotype seen in individuals with rare SNP-associated and monogenic diabetes.

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, I've been very lucky to be able to actively participate and been extensively exposed to and got hands-on experiences with
both bioinformatics and phylogenetic studies during the past years. Currently, I based in the United Kingdom, working with 
[Dr Bingxin Lu (卢冰心)](https://icelu.github.io/) and [Dr Ruolin Wu (吴若琳)](https://lynnwrl.github.io/) on 
"Reconstructing Evolutionary dynamics of Copy number Alterations from Multiple samples across cancer types".

# I Like

- Climbing and/or Bouldering (Always rethinking)
- Hiking (Lite version.)
- Fossil hunting (Usually find Belemnoidea instead of Ammonoidea.)
- Star gazing (I've seen the most beautiful Venus.)
- Procreate (I know how to draw an Ichthyosauria.)
- Podcasts: [凡事不烦](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/6352561c87d7f51ee0168042), [天才捕手FM](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/5e77133b418a84a0469fc305), [博物志](https://bowuzhi.fm/), among others.
- Series: [Person of Interest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/) beyonds everything.
- Things that I am ignorant about.

# Extras

- My stage/cafeteria name is "Bagel", but that hardly work in Brussels, so I adopted "Iris".
- I have a Podcast [七小时后](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/67d56f2e9283fc357d6fd399) for bedtime stories.
- This website is an extended version of my CV, so you need to read more.
