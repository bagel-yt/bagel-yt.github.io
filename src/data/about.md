# Intro

I am an interdisciplinary biomedical scientist.
Through hands-on clinical practice, disease modelling using stem cell– and organoid-based systems, and genomics-driven projects, I have developed a multidisciplinary perspective on how complex diseases arise, progress, and diversify across individuals.

&nbsp;

These experiences have shaped my interest in biomedical research that integrates experimental platforms, molecular genetics, and quantitative thinking, while also requiring careful project coordination and cross-disciplinary collaboration. I am particularly motivated by work that translates complex biological and clinical data into structured, interpretable insights that can inform downstream research and decision-making.

&nbsp;

In particular, my interests center on:

1. **Translational research and Project Coordination**
2. **Disease Modelling and Stem Cell Biology**
3. **Molecular Genetics and Genomics**
4. **Phylogenetics and Evolutionary Biology**

I completed my PhD at [ULB Center for Diabetes Research](https://www.ucdr.be) under the
supervision of [Prof Miriam Cnop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Cnop), where my work focused on disease mechanism 
discovery using stem cell-derived organoid disease models in a translational research setting. By leveraging clinical and omics resources, my doctoral research used iPSC-derived islets to study variant-specific mechanisms underlying rare SNP-associated and monogenic forms of diabetes and neurological disorders, modelling patient-specific phenotypes.

&nbsp;

I received my medical degree from from The Second Xiangya Hospital,[Central South University](https://dmkeylab.csu.edu.cn/),
under the supervison of [Prof Zhiguang Zhou (周智广)](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/zhouzhiguang/en/index.htm).
While trained as a physician, my medical education consistently reinforced my interest in the biological mechanisms of disease and the value of integrating clinical observation with experimental and analytical approaches.

&nbsp;

In parallel with wet-lab and clinical research, I have been fortunate to gain substantial exposure to bioinformatics and
phylogenetic analyses over the past several years. I am currently based in the United Kingdom, working with
[Dr Bingxin Lu (卢冰心)](https://icelu.github.io/) and [Dr Ruolin Wu (吴若琳)](https://lynnwrl.github.io/) on
"Reconstructing Evolutionary dynamics of Copy number Alterations from Multiple samples across cancer types".

&nbsp;

Outside of research, climbing has become an important long-term practice for me. Beyond the physical aspect, climbing has shaped how I think about preparation, risk management, and incremental progress under uncertainty. I am actively training toward formal instructor qualifications, with a strong emphasis on safety, responsibility, and contributing to the climbing community.

# I Like

- Climbing and/or Bouldering (constant problem-solving, constant rethinking, see my climbing page for more fun!)
- Hiking (Lite version.)
- Fossil hunting (Usually find Belemnoidea instead of Ammonoidea.)
- Star gazing (I've seen the most beautiful Venus.)
- Procreate (I know how to draw an Ichthyosauria.)
- Podcasts: [凡事不烦](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/6352561c87d7f51ee0168042), [天才捕手FM](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/5e77133b418a84a0469fc305), [博物志](https://bowuzhi.fm/), and a series of crime storytelling among others.
- Series: [Person of Interest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/) beyonds everything. Though, I also enjoy [The Adventures of Tintin](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLhOnau-tupSTtzeAeWjtIPCeD5mzzs_N) quite a lot.
- Things that I am ignorant about.

# Extras

- My stage/cafeteria name is "Bagel", but that hardly work in Brussels, so I adopted "Iris".
- I have a Podcast [七小时后](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/67d56f2e9283fc357d6fd399) for bedtime stories.
- This website is an extended, more personal view to my CV — feel free to explore beyond the highlights.
